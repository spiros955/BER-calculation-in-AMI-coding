# BER-calculation-in-AMI-coding

This project took place for the course of *Intergrated Communication Systems* in 2018. 

# Description

Using **MATLAB** we simulated a digital communication system using the **Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI)** encoding technique. Our goal was to test the **bit-error-rate(BER)** performance on the receiver and compare it with the ΒΕR-SNR theoretical curve.

## Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI)

AMI is a synchronous clock encoding technique that uses bipolar pulses to represent logical 1. The next logic 1 is represented by a pulse of the opposite polarity. Hence a sequence of logical 1s are represented by a sequence of pulses of alternating polarity.
